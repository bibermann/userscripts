# Userscripts

To be able to install any [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript), you have to install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey (Firefox-only)](https://www.greasespot.net/) browser extension.

To install a userscript from this repository, open the respective `*.user.js` file in GitHub and click on the `Raw` button (on the right, above the source code). This will redirect you to the Tampermonkey extension where you can review and install the userscript.
